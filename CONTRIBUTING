We are not currently accepting pull requests. This software may be used in APS
Networks proprietary software, and therefore we do not wish to accept any
contributions under the GPL as this would effectively poison the project from
a licensing point of view. We may decide to either create a CLA or a PR template
with a licence exception for APS, but we think it's safer at this stage to not
to do anything at all.
